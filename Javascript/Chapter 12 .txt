Javascript can be run using Quokka.js plugin

Javascript is a single threaded programming language

But Java is a multiple threaded programming language

But service worker in JS allow us to run in multiple thread at a time

Javascript is a syncronouse language

Javascript run from top to bottom

Javascript run using node 

node index.js

It is possible to make Javascript assynchronous means we can run another program without blocking first one

setTimeout( ()=> {
console.log("Running");
},3000);


Event loop check the stack is empty and Quee has content

Async js pgm will be executed only after stack is empty

Async pgm like setTimeout will go to web API first 

Then it move to Quee

Then Event loop move it to stack when stack became empty


How the below code work 

setTimeout( ()=> {
console.log("Running");
},0);

The above code will work only after all sync programm worked

The blow code is also moved to Quee and wait for next click this

const button document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
	console.log("Button Clicked");
});
