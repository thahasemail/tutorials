1. With PHP, there are two basic ways to get output: echo and print.

2. The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. 
	echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.

3. The echo statement can be used with or without parentheses: echo or echo()

4. echo "This ", "string ", "was ", "made ", "with multiple parameters.";

5. The PHP print Statement

The print statement can be used with or without parentheses: print or print().
